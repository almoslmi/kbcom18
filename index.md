# Overview
The 1st Workshop on Knowledge Base Construction, Reasoning and Mining (KBCOM) is a new workshop that will be co-located with [WSDM 2018](http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2018/). The success of data mining and search technologies is largely attributed to the efficient and effective analysis of structured data. The construction of well-structured, machine-actionable knowledge bases from raw data sources is often the premise of consequent applications. Automated construction, mining and reasoning of the knowledge bases have become possible as research advances in many related areas such as information extraction, natural language processing, data mining, search, machine learning, and databases. This workshop aims to gather together leading experts from industry and academia to share their visions about the field, discuss latest research results, and exchange exciting ideas. 

We aim to complement the main conference by trying to achieve the following goals:
+ *Research horizons in KBCOM*: The workshop focuses on **invited talks** from leading researchers and **position papers**. Its program comprises a good number of keynote speakers from leaders in both academia and industry. We have [inivted speakers]() from leading universities (Stanford, University of Washington, UCSB and more) and industrial organizations like Amazon, Allen institute for artificial intelligence and Recruit Institute of Technology.

+ *Idea exchange in KBCOM*: The program will organize a poster session for researchers working in KBCOM to share ideas, brainstorm, and collect feedbacks. In particular, we encourage authors to publish new softwares and datasets on related topics and will hold novel shared tasks to help develop a better community for KBCOM.

We expect the highlight of the workshop to be the discussions and brainstorming during invited talks and poster session, where participants can understand and help shape the future of this rapidly growing field. We will also accept submission of both completed and forward-looking work which will be presented either as *highlight talks* or during the poster session. With such unique focuses, KBCOM workshop aims to provide a vivid forum of discussion about knowledge base-related research.
