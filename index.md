# Overview
The success of data mining and search technologies is largely attributed to the efficient and effective analysis of structured data. The construction of well-structured, machine-actionable knowledge bases from raw data sources is often the premise of consequent applications. Automated construction, mining and reasoning of the knowledge bases have become possible as research advances in many related areas such as information extraction, natural language processing, data mining, search, machine learning, and databases. However, there are still substantial scientific and engineering challenges in advancing and integrating such relevant methodologies. The KBCOME workshop aims to gather together leading experts from industry and academia to share their visions about the field, discuss latest research results, and exchange exciting ideas. 

KBCOME workshop focuses on invited talks from leading researchers, position paper submissions and discussions, while also including traditional paper submissions for contributed talks and poster presentation. The program comprises a good number of keynote speakers from leaders in both academia and industry. We have [inivted speakers]() from leading universities (Stanford, University of Washington, UCSB and more) and industrial organizations like Amazon, Allen institute for artificial intelligence and Recruit Institute of Technology. With such unique focuses, KBCOM will provide a vivid forum of discussion about knowledge base-related research.
