**Submission website**: [https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kbcom2018](https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=kbcom2018)

**Submission deadline**: November 12, 2017 

The _1st Workshop on Knowledge Base Construction, Reasoning and Mining (KBCOM)_ is a new workshop that will be co-located with [WSDM 2018](http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2018/). The success of data mining and search technologies is largely attributed to the efficient and effective analysis of structured data. Automated construction, mining and reasoning of _knowledge bases and graphs_ have become possible as research advances in many related areas such as _information extraction_, _natural language processing_, _machine learning_ and _databases_. KBCOM aims to gather together leading experts from industry and academia to share their visions about the field, discuss latest research results, and exchange exciting ideas.

We aim to complement the main conference by trying to achieve the following goals:

*   _Research horizons in KBCOM_: The workshop focuses on **invited talks** from leading experts and **position papers** discussing forward-looking work. Its program comprises a good number of [keynote speakers](http://kbcom.org/1-speaker.html) from both leading universities (Stanford, University of Washington and more) and industrial organizations like Amazon and Recruit Institute of Technology.
*   _Idea exchange in KBCOM_: We will organize a **poster session** for researchers to share ideas, collect feedbacks and form collaborations. We particularly encourage participants to publish **new software and datasets** on related topics, and will hold novel **shared tasks** to help develop a better community.

We expect the highlight of the workshop to be the discussions and brainstorming during invited talks and the poster session. The workshop will also accept **regular submissions** of both full and short papers which will be presented either as _highlight talks_ or during the poster session. With such focuses, KBCOM aims to provide a vivid forum of discussion about knowledge base-related research.

Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:

*   **Knowledge Base Construction**:
    *   information extraction: named entity recognition, relation extraction, entity resolution, synonym mining;
    *   ontology construction; information integration; schema alignment, ontology alignment;
    *   tools and systems for automated knowledge base construction;
    *   structured prediction methods on text, sequence labeling methods on text;
    *   distant supervision, weak supervision techniques for text;
    *   Human-in-the-loop techniques for KB construction.
*   **Mining and Reasoning over Knowledge Bases**:
    *   structured search, KB querying, semantic search;
    *   representation learning on network/graph, knowledge graph embedding, knowledge base completion/population, link prediction;
    *   knowledge-based systems, probabilistic knowledge bases, graph databases.
*   **Knowledge Base-related Applications**:
    *   KB-based QA, hybrid QA, QA with open-domain facts;
    *   Injecting rule/logic into recommendation systems, recommendation with knowledge bases;
    *   web search using knowledge bases, search by example; user study in KB-related applications, user interface, best practices.

## Submission and Review Guidelines

All papers will be peer reviewed, single-blinded. Papers must be submitted in PDF according to the new ACM format published in [ACM guidelines](http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template), selecting the generic "sigconf" sample. The PDF files must have all non-standard fonts embedded. Submissions must be self-contained and in English. 

We are soliciting submissions in three categories of papers: 

*   Full workshop papers (8 pages + 1 page for references) 
*   Short workshop papers (4 pages + 1 page for references)  
*   Position papers (2-4 pages)

## Organization and Contact

The workshop is organized by [Xiang Ren](http://xren7.web.engr.illinois.edu/) (USC), [Craig Knoblock](http://usc-isi-i2.github.io/knoblock/) (USC/ISI)，[William Wang](https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~william/) (UCSB), and [Yu Su](http://cs.ucsb.edu/~ysu/) (UCSB). All questions about submissions should be emailed to [info@kbcom.org](mailto:info@kbcom.org).
