    <h4 id="callforpapers">Call for Papers</h4>
    
    <p>The <em>1st Workshop on Knowledge Base Construction, Reasoning and Mining (KBCOM)</em> is a new workshop that will be co-located with <a href="http://www.wsdm-conference.org/2018/">WSDM 2018</a>. The success of data mining and search technologies is largely attributed to the efficient and effective analysis of structured data. Automated construction, mining and reasoning of <em>knowledge bases and graphs</em> have become possible as research advances in many related areas such as <em>information extraction</em>, <em>natural language processing</em>, <em>machine learning</em> and <em>databases</em>. KBCOM aims to gather together leading experts from industry and academia to share their visions about the field, discuss latest research results, and exchange exciting ideas.</p>
    
    <p>We aim to complement the main conference by trying to achieve the following goals:</p>
    
    <ul>
    <li><em>Research horizons in KBCOM</em>: The workshop focuses on <strong>invited talks</strong> from leading experts and <strong>position papers</strong> discussing forward-looking work. Its program comprises a good number of <a href="http://kbcom.org/1-speaker.html">keynote speakers</a> from both leading universities (Stanford, University of Washington and more) and industrial organizations like Amazon and Recruit Institute of Technology.</li>
    
    <li><em>Idea exchange in KBCOM</em>: We will organize a <strong>poster session</strong> for researchers to share ideas, collect feedbacks and form collaborations. We particularly encourage participants to publish <strong>new software and datasets</strong> on related topics, and will hold novel <strong>shared tasks</strong> to help develop a better community.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We expect the highlight of the workshop to be the discussions and brainstorming during invited talks and the poster session. The workshop will also accept <strong>regular submissions</strong> of original research or position/visionary papers which will be presented either as <em>highlight talks</em> or during the poster session. With such focuses, KBCOM aims to provide a vivid forum of discussion about knowledge base-related research.</p>

    </li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4 id="submissionguidelines">Submission Guidelines</h4>
    
    <p>All papers will be peer reviewed, <strong>single-blinded</strong>. Submissions must be self-contained and in English. Papers must be submitted in PDF according to the new ACM format published in <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">ACM guidelines</a>, selecting the generic "sigconf" sample. <strong>The accepted papers will be published on the workshop's website and will not be considered archival for resubmission purposes.</strong></p>
